## Update Triggers

Dashboard should be updated:
1. After task processing completes
2. When user requests "update dashboard"
3. On scheduled intervals (e.g., hourly)
4. After critical system events
5. Before generating reports

## Performance Considerations

**Keep updates fast:**
- Cache folder counts (don't recount every second)
- Limit log parsing to most recent file
- Use file count (not content scanning) where possible
- Update asynchronously when possible

**Avoid:**
- Reading all files in /Done (filter by date)
- Parsing every log entry (limit to last N)
- Expensive calculations on every update

## Customization

Users may want to add:
- Custom metrics specific to their workflow
- Business-specific KPIs
- Integration with external services
- Time-based trends (charts, graphs)
- Budget tracking
- Client-specific sections

## Error Handling

If data collection fails:
- Show "N/A" for missing data
- Log the error
- Continue with partial update
- Add alert about data collection issue

**Example:**
```markdown
| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Tasks in Needs_Action | N/A (Error reading folder) |
```
