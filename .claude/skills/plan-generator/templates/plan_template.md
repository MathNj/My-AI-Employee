## Safety & Constraints

- ✅ This plan defines WHAT to do, not HOW (execution details in skill docs)
- ✅ All approval thresholds from Company_Handbook.md must be respected
- ✅ External actions (email, posts) require human approval by default
- ✅ No steps execute until approved (where applicable)
- ✅ Each step is atomic and assigned to ONE skill
- ✅ Plans are read-only guides - execution handled by downstream skills

## Next Actions

1. Review this plan for completeness
2. Proceed with Step 1
3. Complete checkboxes as steps finish
4. Handle approval checkpoints when reached
5. Move task to /Done when all steps complete
6. Update Dashboard with status
