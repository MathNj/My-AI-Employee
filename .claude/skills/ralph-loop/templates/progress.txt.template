# Ralph Progress Log
Started: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

## Codebase Patterns
(Add reusable patterns here as you discover them)
- AI Employee uses /Needs_Action → /Approved → /Done workflow
- All actions require HITL approval in /Pending_Approval
- Logs stored in /Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json format
- Frontmatter required for all .md files with type, status, created fields
- MCP servers configured in .claude/mcp.json

## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - US-XXX
- What was implemented
- Files created/changed:
  - path/to/file1.py (new/updated)
  - path/to/file2.md (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern discovered
  - Gotcha encountered
  - Useful context
