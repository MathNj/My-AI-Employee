- Professional banner image (1584 x 396 px)
- Clear logo (300 x 300 px minimum)
- Complete "About" section
- Website link
- Contact information
- Relevant keywords in description

### Post Best Practices

✅ **DO:**

**1. Write Professional, Insightful Content**
```
Good Example:
"We've analyzed 500+ SaaS onboarding flows and found 3 patterns that predict
80% retention. Here's what we learned: [insights]"

Bad Example:
"Check out our awesome product! Buy now! 🔥🔥🔥"
```

**2. Use Data and Metrics**
```
Good: "Our clients see an average 47% increase in productivity"
Bad: "Our clients are more productive"
```

**3. Tell Stories**
```
Good: "Last quarter, a client came to us struggling with... Here's how we
helped and what changed..."
Bad: "We solve problems. Contact us."
```

**4. Ask Thought-Provoking Questions**
```
Good: "How is AI changing your industry? We're seeing 3 major shifts..."
Bad: "What do you think?"
```

**5. Use Strategic Hashtags**
- 3-5 relevant hashtags
- Mix of broad and niche
- Industry-specific terms
- Placed at end of post

❌ **DON'T:**

**1. Over-Promote**
```
Bad: "Buy our product! 50% off! Limited time!"
Good: "We've helped 100+ companies solve [problem]. Here's what we learned..."
```

**2. Use Excessive Emojis**
```
Bad: "🔥🔥🔥 Amazing news!!! 🎉🎉🎉 Check it out!!! 💪💪💪"
Good: "Exciting news! 🎉 We've launched our new feature..."
```

**3. Post Too Frequently**
- Maximum: 1-2 posts per day
- Quality over quantity
- Space posts 4-6 hours apart

**4. Share Low-Value Content**
- No "Tag someone who..." posts
- No "Like if you agree"
- No pure promotional content

### LinkedIn Content Formatting

**Structure for Maximum Engagement:**

```markdown
[Hook - 1-2 sentences that grab attention]

[Body - Main insight, story, or value]
- Use line breaks for readability
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 lines)
- Use bullet points where appropriate

[Call-to-Action]

#Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 #Hashtag3
```

**Example:**
```
We just analyzed 10,000 LinkedIn posts to find what actually drives engagement.
The results surprised us.

Contrary to popular belief, longer posts (1,200+ characters) perform 40% better
than short updates. Here's why:

• Longer content signals value and expertise
• The algorithm favors time spent on post
• Readers engage more with substance

But there's a catch: The first 2 lines must hook readers before "see more" truncates.

What's your experience with long vs short content?

### LinkedIn Article Guidelines

**When to Post Articles vs Posts:**

**Post (Regular Update):**
- Quick insights
- Company updates
- Engagement questions
- Under 1,300 characters

**Article:**
- Deep-dive content
- How-to guides
- Thought leadership
- Over 1,300 characters

**Article Structure:**
1. Attention-grabbing title (40-60 characters)
2. Custom cover image (1200 x 627 px)
3. Strong opening paragraph
4. Subheadings every 2-3 paragraphs
5. Data and examples
6. Clear call-to-action
