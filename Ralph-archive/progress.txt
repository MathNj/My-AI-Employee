# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- AI Employee uses /Needs_Action → /Approved → /Done workflow
- All actions require HITL approval in /Pending_Approval
- Logs stored in /Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json format
- Frontmatter required for all .md files with type, status, created fields

## 2026-01-13 00:15 - US-001
- Implemented: Test completion file for Ralph Loop verification
- Files created/changed:
  - AI_Employee_Vault/Done/TEST_ralph_loop_success.md (new)
  - AI_Employee_Vault/Ralph/prd.json (updated - marked US-001 as passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Ralph Loop successfully reads prd.json and identifies incomplete tasks
  - File creation in /Done folder works correctly with proper YAML frontmatter
  - Acceptance criteria provide clear, verifiable success conditions
  - Test demonstrates Ralph can work autonomously without manual intervention
  - Single-task PRD completes in one iteration as expected
  - Timestamp generation works correctly (ISO 8601 format)
